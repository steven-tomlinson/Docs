# ASP.NET Core Blazor environments

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Blazor WebAssembly. For general guidance on ASP.NET Core app configuration, see <xref:fundamentals/environments>.

When running an app locally, the environment defaults to Development. When the app is published, the environment defaults to Production.

A hosted Blazor WebAssembly app picks up the environment from the server via a middleware that communicates the environment to the browser by adding the `blazor-environment` header. The value of the header is the environment. The hosted Blazor app and the server app share the same environment. For more information, including how to configure the environment, see <xref:fundamentals/environments>.

For a standalone app running locally, the development server adds the `blazor-environment` header to specify the Development environment. To specify the environment for other hosting environments, add the `blazor-environment` header.

In the following example for IIS, add the custom header to the published `web.config` file. The `web.config` file is located in the `bin/Release/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/publish` folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>

    ...

    <httpProtocol>
      <customHeaders>
        <add name="blazor-environment" value="Staging" />
      </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use a custom `web.config` file for IIS that isn't overwritten when the app is published to the `publish` folder, see <xref:blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly#use-a-custom-webconfig>.

Obtain the app's environment in a component by injecting <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> and reading the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.Environment> property:

```razor
@page "/"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting
@inject IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment HostEnvironment

<h1>Environment example</h1>

<p>Environment: @HostEnvironment.Environment</p>
```

During startup, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostBuilder> exposes the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment> through the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.WebAssemblyHostBuilder.HostEnvironment> property, which enables developers to have environment-specific logic in their code:

```csharp
if (builder.HostEnvironment.Environment == "Custom")
{
    ...
};
```

The following convenience extension methods permit checking the current environment for Development, Production, Staging, and custom environment names:

* `IsDevelopment()`
* `IsProduction()`
* `IsStaging()`
* `IsEnvironment("{ENVIRONMENT NAME}")`

```csharp
if (builder.HostEnvironment.IsStaging())
{
    ...
};

if (builder.HostEnvironment.IsEnvironment("Custom"))
{
    ...
};
```

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting.IWebAssemblyHostEnvironment.BaseAddress?displayProperty=nameWithType> property can be used during startup when the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.NavigationManager> service isn't available.
